                        former student of theirs<br>who can only say wonderful things<br>about the program. The entire<br>
                        curriculum and staff did not<br>disappoint. They were very hands-on<br>and I never had to wait long
                        for<br>assistance. The agile team project, in<br>particular, was outstanding. It took<br>my learning to
                        the next level in a way<br>that no tutorial could ever have. In<br>fact, I’ve often referred to it
                        during<br>interviews as an example of my<br>development experience. It certainly<br>helped me land a job
